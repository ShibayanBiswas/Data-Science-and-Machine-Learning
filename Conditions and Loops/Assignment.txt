
(a) Output of the following program will be :
n = 15
#Check If the number is between 1 to 10
if n>=1 and n<=10:
    print("too low")

#Check If the number is between 11 to 20
elif n>=10 and n<=20:
    print("medium")

#Check If the number is between 21 to 30
elif n>=20 and n<=30:
    print("large")
#Check if the number is greater than 30 
else:
    print("too large")

Answer: medium


(b) Output of the following program will be :
n = 10
#Check If the number is between 1 to 10
if n>=1 and n<=10:
    print("too low")

#Check If the number is between 10 to 20
elif n>=10 and n<=20:
    print("medium")

#Check If the number is between 20 to 30
elif n>=20 and n<=30:
    print("large")
#Check if the number is greater than 30 
else:
    print("too large")

Answer: too low [As the value of n is 10, the if condition will result in True, and “too low” will be printed. The code will come out after the first block itself since it was true and 
won't go on to check for other if-else conditions]


(c) What will the following code segment print?
x = 15
if x <= 15:
    print("Inside if")
else:

Answer: Inside If


(d) Consider the following piece of code -
x = 5
if x < 6:
    print("Hello")
if x == 5:
    print("Hi")
else:
    print("Hey")
Which of the above 3 print statement(s) will be executed?

Answer: print("Hello"), print("Hi") [The value of x is 5. In the first, if condition, it will check if x is less than 6, which will output True and “Hello” will be printed. In the second 
if condition, it will check if x is equal to 5, which also results in True and “Hi” getting printed on the screen]

(m) Fahrenheit to Celsius- Given three values - Start Fahrenheit Value (S), End Fahrenheit value (E) and Step Size (W), you need to convert all Fahrenheit values from Start to End at the 
gap of W, into their corresponding Celsius values and print the table.

	end = int(input())
	step = int(input())
	currentFahrenheitValue = start
	while(currentFahrenheitValue <= end):
    		celsiusVlue = (5/9) * (currentFahrenheitValue - 32)

(n) Calculator- Write a program that performs the tasks of a simple calculator. The program should first take an integer as input and then based on that integer perform the task as given 
below.
1. If the input is 1, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their sum is printed.
2. If the input is 2, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their difference(1st number - 2nd number) is printed.
3. If the input is 3, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their product is printed.
4. If the input is 4, then 2 integers are taken from the user and the quotient obtained (on dividing 1st number by 2nd number) is printed.
5. If the input is 5, then 2 integers are taken from the user and their remainder(1st number mod 2nd number) is printed.
6. If the input is 6, then the program exits.
7. For any other input, then print "Invalid Operation".

Answer: choice = int(input())
