Answer: 5.40


20. Standard deviation can be negative ?
Answer: False

22. For the dataset : 1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17. Which value is in the 75th percentile ?
Answer: 10 [We want to find the data value for which 75% of the data set is less than or equal to the data value. Note that there are a total of 16 values in the set; thus, 75% of the data set is 12 values. Since the data set is ordered, we need simply find the 12th data value]
