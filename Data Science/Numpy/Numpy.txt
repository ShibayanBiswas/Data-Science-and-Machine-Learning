
(a) What is NumPy library ?
Answer: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions 
to operate on these arrays.


(b) What will be output?
a = np.empty(4, dtype = int)
print(a)
Answer: Integer array of size 4 with all random integers [np.empty returns a new array of given shape and type, with random values]


(c) Random Integer array-
Syntax for creating a random integer array ranging from 0 to 10 of size (4, 4)
Answer: np.random.randint(10, size = (4, 4)) [np.random.randint returns random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive). The syntax is : np.random.randint(10, size = (4, 4))]


(d) What is the output?
np.random.randint(10, 4)
Answer: Error [np.random.randint returns random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive). But here the indexing is high to low. That's why it produces error]


(e) What is the output?
np.random.rand()
Answer: One random value [The np.random.rand() function creates an array of specified shapes and fills it with random values]


(f) What will be the output ?
  np.arange(10)
Answer: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) [Return evenly spaced values within a given interval. Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (in other words, the 
interval including start but excluding stop). For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in range function, but returns an ndarray rather than a list. When using 
a non-integer step, such as 0.1, it is often better to use numpy.linspace]


(g) What will be the output on executing following code ?
a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
a.shape
Answer: (4,) [A NumPy array's shape property always returns a tuple]
