Note: Python offers two functions int() and float() to be used with the input() function to convert the values received through the input() into the respective numeric types integer and
floating-point numbers. The steps will be:-
1. Use the input() function to read the user input.
2. Use the int() and float() function to convert the value read into integers and floating-point numbers, respectively. This process is called Type Casting.

Questions:

1. What will the following code segment print?
print(“Career”)
print(“Labs”)

Answer: Career Labs(in next line)


2. What will be the output of the given code segment?
a = 10
b = 20 
multiple = a*b
print("multiple")

Answer: multiple


3. What will be the output of the given code segment?
a = 10
b = 20 
multiple = a*b
print(multiple)

Answer: 200


4. Select correct variable name(s) -
One or more options may be correct

Answer: var1, var_1, _var1 


5. What will be the result of following code in Python ?
x = 10
x = "abcd"
print(x)

Answer: abcd


6. Consider the python code below -
x = "abcd"
x = 10
What is the type of x after the code executes ?

Answer: int


7. Will id1 and id2 have same value?
a = 10
id1 = id(a)
b = a + 2-2
id2 = id(b)

Answer: Yes [In python, the values are stored in a separate memory. And an address/id is stored in the variable, which points to that memory location. So, if “10” is stored in both “a” and 
“b”, the id is going to be the same for both of these]

8. What will be the output of following statement?
print(17//10)

Answer: 1 [“//” in python is called “Floor division” operator. The division in the whole number is adjusted to the left in the number line]


9. What will be the output of following statement?
print(17/10)

Answer: 1.7 ["/", Divides numerator by denominator (Floating Point Division)]


10. What will be the output of the code if the input provided is 40 and 57 ?
a = input()
b = input()
C = a+b
print(C)
Note that the double quotes given in the options is to denote that it is a string. It wouldn't appear in the final output.

Answer: "4057" [input() function always returns a value of the String type]


11. What will be the output of the code if input provided is 40 and 57 ?
a =int (input())
b= int (input())
C = a+b
print(C)

Answer: 97


12. What will be the output of the code if input provided is “abc” and “def”?
a = int(input())
b=int(input())
C = a+b
print(C)

Answer: Value Error [If the input is type cast as int(), then it expects the input only in the form of integers and produces a "Value Error" if given other than integers]


13. Find average Marks- Write a program to input marks of three tests of a student (all integers). Then calculate and print the average of all test marks.

Answer: test_1=int(input())
	test_2=int(input())
	test_3=int(input())
	average=(test_1+test_2+test_3)/3
	print(average)


14. Find X raised to power N- You are given two integers: X and N. You have to calculate X raised to power N and print it.

Answer: base=int(input())
	power=int(input())
	result=base**power
	print(result)


15. Arithmetic Progression- You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it.

Answer: term_1=int(input())
	term_2=int(input())
	term_3=int(input())
	common_difference=(term_3-term_1)//(3-1)	#Here we have three terms
	print(common_difference)


16. Rectangular Area- You are given a rectangle in a plane. The coordinates of one of its diagonals are provided to you. You have to print the total area of the rectangle.
The coordinates of the rectangle are provided as four integral values: x1, y1, x2, y2. It is given that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.

Answer: x_1=int(input())
	y_1=int(input())
	x_2=int(input())
	y_2=int(input())
	area=(x_2-x_1)*(y_2-y_1)	#Formula for area when co-ordinates of diagonal is given
	print(area)
