
(a) Why is Panda Package used in python ?
Answer: Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims 
to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.


(b) Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
Answer: Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet. Ordered and unordered time series data. Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or 
heterogeneous) with row and column labels.


(c) Consider the below code:
    import pandas as pd 
    iris =   pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
    print(type(iris))
Answer: < class ‘pandas.core.frame.Dataframe’> [pd.read_csv reads a comma-separated values (CSV) file into DataFrame. The print(type(iris)) returns <class ‘pandas.core.frame.Dataframe’>]


(d) Which statement is true about iris dataset:
Answer: The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).  In iris dataset 4 features were measured from 
each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. 


(e) What all statements are true:
Answer: Scikit focus on modeling data. Scikit not focused on loading, manipulating and summarizing data. NumPy and Pandas are used for loading, manipulating and summarizing data features.


(f) Consider below code:
    import pandas as pd     
    iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
    df = iris
Any changes done in df will reflect in iris ?
Answer: true [ df = iris make both df and iris point to the same object, hence any changes done by df will reflect]


(g) Consider below code:
	import pandas as pd     
	iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
	df = iris.copy()
Changes via df will reflect in iris ?
Answer: false [df = iris.copy() make a copy of iris, hence any changes done by df will not reflect in iris]


(h) Consider below code:
	import pandas as pd   
	iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
Pick the correct option to summarize how many null entry in each column
Answer: iris.isnull().sum() [The isnull() method returns a DataFrame object where all the values are replaced with a Boolean value True for NULL values, and otherwise False. The sum 
method sums up all the null values present in a particular column]


(i) From the iris dataset used, Pick the correct statement to get data from row 1 to 3 with only 2nd column:
	import pandas as pd 
	iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
Answer: iris.iloc[1:4, 2:3]


(j) Consider below code:
import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
iris.drop(0)
print(iris)
Above code will result in -
Answer: No changes in iris dataframe [The drop() method removes the specified row or column. But it does that on the copy of the original dataframe. And returns that copy and original 
dataframe remains the same. So when the iris is printed it remains the same]


(k) Consider below code:
import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
iris.drop(0, inplace = True)
drop method in above code makes which one of the following changes in iris dataframe
Answer: Delete one row in iris dataframe itself [When inplace parameter is used in the drop method, it deletes the row or column in the original dataframe]



(l) Consider below code:
import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
iris.drop(0,inplace= True)
iris.drop(0,inplace= True)
print(iris)
what will be the output -
Answer: Error [Row with label 0 got deleted in first drop method call so it will fail in calling drop method again on same label]


(m) Which feature will separate the Flower 1 from flower 2 & 3?
Answer: petal_length, petal_width
