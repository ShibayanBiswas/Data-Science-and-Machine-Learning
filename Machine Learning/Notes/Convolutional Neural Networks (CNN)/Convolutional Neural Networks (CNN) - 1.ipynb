He built the first convolutional neural network called LeNet in 1988. LeNet was used for character recognition tasks like reading zip codes and digits.\r\n","\r\n","Have you ever wondered how facial recognition works on social media, or how object detection helps in building self-driving cars, or how disease detection is done using visual imagery in healthcare? It’s all possible thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNN). Here’s an example of convolutional neural networks that illustrates how they work:\r\n","\r\n","Imagine there’s an image of a bird, and you want to identify whether it’s really a bird or some other object. The first thing you do is feed the pixels of the image in the form of arrays to the input layer of the neural network (multi-layer networks used to classify things). The hidden layers carry out feature extraction by performing different calculations and manipulations. There are multiple hidden layers like the convolution layer, the ReLU layer, and pooling layer, that perform feature extraction from the image. Finally, there’s a fully connected layer that identifies the object in the image.\r\n","\r\n","<img src = \"https://files.codingninjas.in/convolutional_neural_network_to_identify_the_image_of_a_bird-7737.png\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WeUKXzOQPsSG"},"source":["In machine learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.\r\n","\r\n","CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.\r\n","\r\n","Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.\r\n","\r\n","CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing.\r\n","\r\n","A CNN consists of an input and an output layer, as well as multiple hidden layers. The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers.\r\n","\r\n","Description of the process as a convolution in neural networks is by convention. Mathematically it is a cross-correlation rather than a convolution. This only has significance for the indices in the matrix, and thus which weights are placed at which index."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Sfgaez7kWDx-"},"source":["##**Why should we use CNN ?**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z9T6XlszWFkH"},"source":["**Problem with Feedforward Neural Network**\r\n","\r\n","Suppose you are working with MNIST dataset, you know each image in MNIST is 28 x 28 x 1(black & white image contains only 1 channel). Total number of neurons in input layer will 28 x 28 = 784, this can be manageable. What if the size of image is 1000 x 1000 which means you need 10⁶ neurons in input layer. Oh! This seems a huge number of neurons are required for operation. It is computationally ineffective right. So here comes Convolutional Neural Network or CNN. In simple word what CNN does is, it extract the feature of image and convert it into lower dimension without loosing its characteristics. In the following example you can see that initial the size of the image is 224 x 224 x 3. If you proceed without convolution then you need 224 x 224 x 3 = 100, 352 numbers of neurons in input layer but after applying convolution you input tensor dimension is reduced to 1 x 1 x 1000. It means you only need 1000 neurons in first layer of feedforward neural network."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Fts59O6NV0Vl"},"source":["##**Stride and Padding**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AAAq9VA9WeI7"},"source":["**Stride** denotes how many steps we are moving in each steps in convolution.

The neurons in this layer look for specific features. If they find the features they are looking for, they produce a high activation.\r\n","\r\n","Convolution can be thought of as a weighted sum between two signals ( in terms of signal processing jargon ) or functions ( in terms of mathematics ). In image processing, to calculate convolution at a particular location $(x, y)$, we extract $k$ x $k$ sized chunk from the image centered at location $(x,y)$. We then multiply the values in this chunk (generally called **filter**) element-by-element with the convolution filter (also sized $k$ x $k$) and then add them all to obtain a single output.\r\n","\r\n","Although fully connected feedforward neural networks can be used to learn features as well as classify data, it is not practical to apply this architecture to images. A very high number of neurons would be necessary, even in a shallow (opposite of deep) architecture, due to the very large input sizes associated with images, where each pixel is a relevant variable. For instance, a fully connected layer for a (small) image of size 100 x 100 has 10000 weights for each neuron in the second layer. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free parameters, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters. For instance, regardless of image size, tiling regions of size 5 x 5, each with the same shared weights, requires only 25 learnable parameters. In this way, it resolves the vanishing or exploding gradients problem in training traditional multi-layer neural networks with many layers by using backpropagation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_MPZ-rFeQE78"},"source":["<img src = \"https://files.codingninjas.in/3test-7738.gif\">\r\n","\r\n","Initially we will assume the weights, and then we will ue forward and backward propogation to optimise these weights.\r\n","\r\n","Each unit on the layer would eventually learn some specific feature of the image."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q68mo2nhQE5d"},"source":["###**ReLU Layer**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vwpUe_P6QE3S"},"source":["ReLU stands for the rectified linear unit.
