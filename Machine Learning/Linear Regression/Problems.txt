14. In the last video we discussed how to write down code for Linear Regression algorithm. So which out of the four functions discussed is this ?
	def fun(x_train, y_train) :
   		num = (x_train * y_train).mean() - x_train.mean() * y_train.mean()
   		den = (x_train ** 2).mean() - x_train.mean() ** 2
   		m = num/den
   		c = y_train.mean() - m * x_train.mean()
   		return m, c
Answer: fit


14. In the last video we discussed how to write down code for Linear Regression algorithm. So which out of the four functions discussed is this ?

    		return m * x + c
Answer: predict


15. In the last video we discussed how to write down code for Linear Regression algorithm. So which out of the four functions discussed is this ?
	def fun(y_truth, y_pred) :
    		u = ((y_truth - y_pred) ** 2).sum()
    		v = ((y_truth - y_truth.mean()) ** 2)).sum()
