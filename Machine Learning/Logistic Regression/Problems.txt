
1. Select the correct statement(s) about using Linear Regression for classification:
Answer: Outliers will spoil the model, Linear Regression will predict continuous values whereas for classification we would need prediction to be in terms of classes(which arenâ€™t continuous)


2. Consider predicted m values for a 2 feature(x1, x2) problem as m1 = 0.5, m2 = 0.2 and m3 = 0.01. Find y prediction for x1 = 100 and x2 = 40 using Linear Regression (y_pred = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3)
Answer: 58.01 


3. Logistic Regression is ___ algorithm.
Answer: Classification


4. Logistic regression is _______ when the observed outcome of dependent variable can have only two values such as 0 and 1 or success and failure.
Answer: Logistic regression is  Binomial when the observed outcome of the dependent variable can have only two values such as 0 and 1 or success and failure


5. Which of the following function is used by logistic regression to get a prediction in the range between (0,1).
Answer: Sigmoid


6. The cut off value for the sigmoid function as discussed is :
Answer: 0.5


7. Consider predicted m values for a 2 feature(x1, x2) problem as m1 = 0.001, m2 = 0.02 and m3 = 0.1. Find the value of h(z), where h(z) is sigmoid function and z = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3 for x1 = 10 and x2 = 80. Fill only the answer and it should be rounded off to 2 decimal places.
Answer: 0.85


8. Which of the following statement(s) are correct:
Answer: We can use One vs Rest method to use Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification, We can use Multinomial method to use Logistic Regression for Multiclass Classification


9. In the One vs Rest method for Multiclass classification, sum of probabilities of all classes(achieved by one model for every class) equals 1.
Answer: False


10. In Multinomial method for Multi class classification, sum of probabilities of every classes equals 1.
Answer: True


11. What can be one possible drawback of finding complex decision boundaries by adding complicated features to training data ?
Answer: Overfitting


12. In L2 Regularization we find
Answer: Square of parameters


13. In sklearn Logistic Regression classifier for a very large value of C, choose the correct statement(s)
Answer: Regularization term will not be important, It will lead to overfitting


14. In sklearn Logistic Regression classifier for a very low value of C, choose the correct statement(s)
Answer: Cost Function will be important, It will lead to underfitting


15. Suppose I applied a logistic regression model on data and got training accuracy X and testing accuracy Y. Now I want to add few new features in data. Select option(s) which are correct in such case. Note : Consider remaining parameters are same.
	1. Training accuracy always decreases.
	2. Training accuracy always increases or remain same.
	3. Testing accuracy always decreases
	4. Testing accuracy always increases or remain same
Answer: Only 2
