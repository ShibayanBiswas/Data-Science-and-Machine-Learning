Your model predicted 60 entries correctly as class A out of 80 and 75 correctly for class B out of 90. Note : Fill in the entries for the confusion matrix thus build for this model. Output Format : a b c d
	|           | Pred A    | Pred B    |
	|---------  |--------   |--------   |
	| Truth A   | a         | b         |
	| Truth B   | c         | d         |
Answer: 60 20 15 75


2. For the given confusion matrix, choose correct statement(s).
	|           | Pred 0    | Pred 1    |
	|---------  |--------   |--------   |
	| Truth 0   | 45        | 25        |
	| Truth 1   | 30        | 50        |
Answer: Count of False positives is 25, Count of False negatives is 30, Accuracy for the given confusion matrix is 63.3%


3. For the given confusion matrix, choose correct statement(s).
	|           | Pred 0    | Pred 1    |
	|---------  |--------   |--------   |
	| Truth 0   | 45        | 25        |
	| Truth 1   | 30        | 50        |
Answer: Count of true negatives is 45, Count of true positives is 50


4. You are solving a classification problem with a highly imbalanced class. The majority class is occurring 98% of times in the training data.
Now when you come with predictions, your model has 98% accuracy on test data. Which of the following is true in such a case?
	1. Accuracy metric is not a good idea for imbalanced class problems.
	2. Accuracy metric is a good idea for imbalanced class problems.
	3. Precision and recall metrics are good for imbalanced class problems.
	4. Precision and recall metrics arenâ€™t good for imbalanced class problems.
Answer: 1 and 3


5. For the given confusion matrix, choose correct statement(s).
	|           | Pred A    | Pred B    |
	|---------  |--------   |--------   |
	| Truth A   | 100       | 25        |
	| Truth B   | 10        | 50        |
Answer: Precision for class A is 100/110, Precision for class B is 50/75


6. For the given confusion matrix, choose correct statement(s).
	|           | Pred A    | Pred B    |
	|---------  |--------   |--------   |
	| Truth A   | 100       | 25        |
	| Truth B   | 10        | 50        |
Answer: Recall for class A is 100/125, Recall for class B is 50/60
