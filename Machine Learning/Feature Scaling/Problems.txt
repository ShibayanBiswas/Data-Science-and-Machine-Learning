
1. In which class of Machine Learning problems output should be scaled along with the input features?
Answer: None of these. In the classification problem, output variables are discrete so there is no need to normalize it. In the regression problem, scaling the output does not have any effect on the shape of the function. So, only input features should be scaled and not the output variable


2. What is the result of the following data points after MinMax scaling between (0,1) : 
40, 10, 100, 70, 40 ?
Answer: 0.33, 0, 1, 0.66, 0.33


3. What is the result of the following data points after MinMax scaling between (5,20) : 
40, 10, 100, 70, 40 ?
Answer: 10, 5, 20, 15, 10


4. Which of the following present in sklearn is used for feature scaling?
Answer: Preprocessing


5. Which of the following does sklearn.preprocessing do by default
Answer: scale the data to unit variance, center the data before scaling
