
1. Decision trees can be used for ___ problems
Answer: Regression & Classification


2. What all are true about decision tree ?
	A. Decision Tree uses a tree like graph or a model of decision 
	B. In decision tree each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, and each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes)
Answer: Both A and B are Correct about decision tree


3. Below decision tree belongs to : 
Answer: This decision tree produces the output :
	0 0 -> 0
	0 1 -> 1
	1 0 -> 1
	1 1 -> 0
This is the output of XOR gate


4. Consider the decision tree discussed in the video, and answer to below question :
If a student is from Tier 3 College and has an amazing internship(say Facebook) but doesn’t have any project. will this student be able to get a call for the interview according to the above Tree?
Answer: No


5. Finding best decision tree is :
Answer: Is exponential Solution


6. Construct greedy recursive algo for Decision Tree from below given steps :
	A. If no feature is left to split upon, output the majority
	B. If node is pure, output the only class
	C. Find the best feature to split upon
	D. Recursively call on the split
Answer: B → A → C → D
